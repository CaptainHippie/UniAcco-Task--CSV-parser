# UniAcco Task- CSV-parser
 
 ## Prerequisites:

 ## How to run:
1. install pandas library using the command 'pip install pandas' inside the terminal
2. Open a terminal inside the directory
3. Run the program using the command '$ python3 main.py'

The rest is guided by command prompts

Support is added for multiple CSV files, just drop them inside the 'datasets' folder

argparse is depracated because I couldn't find any use for it at the moment, but will try to add if the need arises.

More complex operations using pandas will be added soon
